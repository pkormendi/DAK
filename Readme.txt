This collection of plugins (and loader) make up what I started calling the DAK (Duck Admin Kit?)

This mod can be downloaded via SteamWorkshop, and will autodownload on all clients on connect.
The ModID for DAK is 5f4f178, which you will want to set in the server command line, and in MapCycle.json.  The server will automatically download the mod once set.

*NOTE* - If you decide to load this from Server.lua to bypass mod filter, you will not want to add the ModID to the command line or MapCycle.json

A DAKConfig.json file will be automatically created in the config_path from the server command line, or in %AppData%\Natural Selection 2 if not specified.
As a note, if you decide to load DAKLoader.lua from Server.lua instead of using SteamWorkshop, then you will also want to edit DAKConfig.json, and change 
LoadFromServerLUA to true.  You will also want to make sure that you place the Script.Load("lua/DAKLoader.lua") 
between the Script.Load statement for ServerConfig and Script.Load for Shared.lua - Between lines 13 and 24 currently (B233).

All mods can be enabled/disabled via the DAKconfig.json file.  A sample usable config file is generated by the mod, which uses the recommended values.
Generally the default configuration should work for most instances, if you do customize the messages be sure to maintain the same amount of regex strings (%s, %f, %d).

 Breakdown of current 'Plugins' system and the standard 'Plugins'
 DAK extends various events from the engine, and creates a couple of its own.
 
 kDAKOnClientConnect
 kDAKOnClientDisconnect
 kDAKOnServerUpdate
 kDAKOnClientDelayedConnect
 kDAKOnTeamJoin
 kDAKOnGameEnd
 kDAKOnEntityKilled
 kDAKOnUpdatePregame
 kDAKOnCastVoteByPlayer
 kDAKOnSetGameState
 kDAKOnClientChatMessage
 kDAKCheckMapChange
 kDAKOverrideMapChange
 
 Functions can be added to these variables which will be run when these events occur, sample shown below:
 table.insert(kDAKOnClientDisconnect, function(client) return LogOnClientDisconnect(client) end)
 
 *NOTE* - This has changed for anything running on ServerUpdate, and eventually all Event Hooks will get changed to use the new system.
 DAKRegisterEventHook(kDAKOnServerUpdate, UpdateMapVotes, 5) - (EventArray, Function, Priority) This allows a priority to be set for the Event, the higher the number the greater the priority.
 
 This also allows for the EventHooks to be removed during runtime, for greater efficiency.  
 DAKDeregisterEventHook(kDAKOnServerUpdate, UpdateMapVotes) - (EventArray, Function) - This removes the function from the array, so that it wont be called anymore.
 
 Plugins are loaded from the plugin folder by DAK, with config_ files being loaded to setup config if needed, and plugin_ files containing the plugin logic.
 The config_ files uses an array to track all config functions:
 table.insert(kDAKPluginDefaultConfigs, {PluginName = "AFKKicker", DefaultConfig = function() SetupDefaultConfig() end })
 
 Notes about Gamerules overrides - they require the same args from vanilla NS2, or will need manual configuration.
 This can be changed in DAKLoader.lua, kDAKBaseGamerules is the class name used when setting up the overrides.
 Below are the functions overriden and their default configuration.
 
	function NS2Gamerules:JoinTeam(player, newTeamNumber, force)
	function NS2Gamerules:EndGame(winningTeam)
	function NS2Gamerules:OnEntityKilled(targetEntity, attacker, doer, point, direction)
	function NS2Gamerules:UpdatePregame(timePassed)
	function NS2Gamerules:SetGameState(state)
	function NS2Gamerules:CastVoteByPlayer(voteTechId, player)
	
	Also included is a function to capture chat messages and raise events based on them, disabling the gamerules extensions
	will also disable this.

	function Server.AddChatToHistory(message, playerName, steamId, teamNumber, teamOnly)
	
	Also have added some additional overrides for added logging:
	
	function CommandStructure:LoginPlayer(player)
	function CommandStructure:Logout()
	
	function RecycleMixin:OnResearchComplete(researchId)
	function RecycleMixin:OnResearch(researchId)
	
	function ConstructMixin:OnInitialized()

 These can be disabled in DAKConfig.json, GamerulesExtensions which is under DAKLoader.
 
 Please note that errors caused in functions added are systemic, meaning they will affect the execution of NS2 gamecode, so some care must be taken.
 
 OverrideInterp Plugin
 - This is mainly for testing, however it overrides the default interpolation value of 100ms on each clients connect, making sure that
 the value is correct set client/server side.
 
 AutoConcede Plugin
 - This plugin adds an Automatic Concedede check to the GameEnd function, which will alert players if the teams are different by a configurable amount of players, and will
 end the game if the team imbalance isnt resolved after a configurable amount of time.
 
 AutoMapCycle Plugin
 - This plugin will automatically cycle the map after a configurable amount of time, and with a configurable minimum player count.  It will invoke a MapCycle change, or alternatively
 can be configured to use a specific map list.
 
 BaseAdminCommands Plugin
 - This plugin replaces the basic admin commands that are provided with NS2, and changes some functionality, and also extends some basic functionallity, like offering GameIds for 
 connected players.
 
 CommBans Plugin
 - This plugin allows commander bans to be set, which can be permanent or time based.  They can be added and or removed in game.  This allows adds protection to commander ejecting
 for various admin levels, if the sv_ejectionprotection command is granted.
 
 VoteRandom Plugin
 - This plugin enables players to vote to enable random teams, and supports either randoming the teams instantly, or enabling random teams for a set duration,
 where the next game and all games for a set duration have random teams.
 
 TournamentMode Plugin
 - Made a recent re-visit to this plugin to improve basics regarding it, created basic framework for PCW/Official modes.  May continue to improve
 and add to differences between modes.
 
 ReservedSlots Plugin
 - Basic Reserve slots plugin, however is more a proof of concept and does not have the ability to work in a way that provides a good user experience.
 Basic framework may prove useful should the ability arise to reject clients connection earlier or modify query response.
 
 MOTD Plugin
 - This plugin provides a MOTD system that could be more accurately described as a rules system, which allows clients to accept and have the messages
 not always appear on connect.  Should be loaded as last plugin so that other plugins can stop the messages if needed.  Messages are also sent in groups
 so that they can all be viewed onscreen.
 
 Messages Plugin
 - This plugin provides a periodic message delivery function, which allows for flexible configuration.  The total amount of messages, messages per block, interval between blocks,
 interval between message cycles, and a start delay for message cycling.
 
 MapVote Plugin
 - This plugin provides a map voting system, which will read the mapcycle.txt for cycle time and the list of maps.  On round end a map vote is triggered
 if enough time has elapsed, with a randomly selected list of maps which excludes some of the map last played.  Since NS2 only has 4 offical maps currently
 the plugin will automatically add back in maps if there is not enough to make the minimum.  Almost all parts are configurable in the configs.
 
 AFKKicker Plugin
 - This plugin checks if a player is idle by caching their viewangles and origin, and displays messages to alert them if they are going to be kicked.
 May in the future be improved to use idle parameter on the player.
 
 EnhancedLogging Plugin
 - This plugin enables alot of extra logging, which is done to a seperate directory within the configured server admin path.

 VoteSurrender Plugin
 - This plugin provides a surrender vote system for each team, which can be used to vote for the game to end if a set percentage of the team votes.
 
 UnStuck Plugin
 - This plugin provides an unstuck command for players, and has some basic configurable options for delays to prevent abuse, and to change the unstuck amount.
 
 //Config
 
 Reserve Slot config - ReservedPlayers.json

 -Name is just a friendly name for the user, is not checked in game.
 -ID is the steamID for the user, which is what is used to authenticate them in game.
 -Reason is the reason for why the user has a reserve slot
 -Time is the unix system time of when the reserve slot will expire, 0 will set it to not expire.
